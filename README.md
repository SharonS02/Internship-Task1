Write a Python program to create a list, a dictionary, and a set. Perform basic operations like adding, removing, and modifying elements.

### Explanation:
1. **List Operations:**
   - Created a list and printed it.
   - Used `append()` to add an element.
   - Used `remove()` to delete an element.
   - Modified an element using index access.

2. **Dictionary Operations:**
   - Created a dictionary and printed it.
   - Added a new key-value pair.
   - Deleted a key using `del`.
   - Modified an existing value.

3. **Set Operations:**
   - Created a set and printed it.
   - Used `add()` to include an element.
   - Used `discard()` to remove an element without raising an error.
   - Demonstrated that adding a duplicate does not change the set.
